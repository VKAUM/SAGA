The main function of an operating system is to manage computer hardware and software resources and provide services to software applications.
Multiprogramming allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by sharing the CPU while multitasking involves switching between multiple tasks or processes rapidly to give the appearance of simultaneous execution.
The kernel is the core component of an operating system responsible for managing system resources such as memory CPU and input/output devices and providing essential services to user programs.
Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows the operating system to use hard disk space as a form of RAM. It's used to provide a larger address space for programs than the physical RAM available allowing for efficient multitasking and the running of large programs.
Process scheduling is the method by which the operating system decides which process to run next on the CPU. It involves selecting processes from the ready queue and allocating CPU time to each process based on scheduling algorithms to optimize system performance and resource utilization.
A process control block (PCB) is a data structure maintained by the operating system that contains information about a process such as its process ID state priority CPU registers and memory allocation.
The file system in an operating system provides a structured way to store retrieve and organize files on storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs.
System calls are interfaces provided by the operating system that allow user-level processes to request services from the kernel such as input/output operations process management and memory allocation.
A process is an instance of a program that is being executed by the operating system. It consists of an executable code associated data and system resources such as CPU time memory and I/O devices.
A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used for process synchronization in a multi-process environment. It allows processes to coordinate access to shared resources by controlling access through wait() and signal() operations.
The scheduler in an operating system is responsible for determining the order in which processes are executed on the CPU. It selects processes from the ready queue and allocates CPU time to each process based on scheduling algorithms to optimize system performance and resource utilization.
Deadlock occurs when two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource resulting in a cyclic dependency. Starvation occurs when a process is denied necessary resources indefinitely due to other processes being allocated those resources repeatedly.
A device driver is a specialized program that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices such as printers graphics cards and network adapters.
User-level threads are managed entirely by user-level libraries without kernel support while kernel-level threads are managed by the operating system kernel which provides better concurrency and parallelism support.
A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. It can be prevented by ensuring that processes request and release resources in a specific order or by using deadlock detection and recovery algorithms.
Virtualization in operating systems refers to the creation of a virtual version of a resource such as hardware operating system or storage allowing multiple instances of these resources to run concurrently on a single physical machine.
A monolithic kernel contains all operating system functions and services in a single executable image while a microkernel architecture separates the operating system into small modular components that run in user space providing only essential services in the kernel space.
Paging is a memory management scheme that allows the operating system to divide physical memory into fixed-size blocks called pages and manage them independently enabling efficient use of memory and facilitating virtual memory implementation.
Preemptive scheduling allows the operating system to interrupt the execution of a process to allocate CPU time to another process while non-preemptive scheduling does not allow such interruptions and relies on processes voluntarily yielding CPU control.
The process state diagram is a graphical representation of the various states that a process can be in during its execution including new ready running waiting and terminated states showing transitions between these states based on process execution and resource availability.
A race condition occurs when two or more processes or threads access shared data or resources in an unpredictable manner leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior. It can be avoided by using synchronization mechanisms such as locks semaphores or atomic operations.
Mutual exclusion is a synchronization technique that ensures that only one process or thread can access a shared resource at a time preventing conflicts and data corruption. It can be implemented using locks semaphores or other synchronization primitives.
A page fault occurs when a process accesses a page of memory that is not currently in physical memory but is instead stored in secondary storage such as a hard drive. The operating system handles page faults by retrieving the required page from secondary storage and updating the page table to reflect its new location in physical memory.
The system call interface provides a set of functions and services that user-level processes can invoke to request services from the operating system kernel such as file operations process management and memory allocation.
Internal fragmentation occurs when allocated memory is larger than required leading to wasted memory within allocated blocks while external fragmentation occurs when free memory is fragmented into small non-contiguous blocks that cannot be used to satisfy large memory allocation requests.
The address translation mechanism converts logical addresses generated by user-level programs into physical addresses used by the underlying hardware enabling memory isolation and protection and facilitating virtual memory management.
A logical address is an address generated by a program or process also known as a virtual address while a physical address is the actual memory location in physical memory where data is stored.
A context switch occurs when the operating system switches the CPU from executing one process to another. It occurs when a process is interrupted or blocked requiring the CPU to save the state of the current process and restore the state of the next process to be executed.
Memory protection is a mechanism provided by the operating system to prevent unauthorized access to memory regions ensuring that processes can only access memory areas that they have permission to access thus enhancing system security and stability.
Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) refers to a multiprocessor system architecture in which two or more identical processors are connected to a single shared main memory and are capable of executing the same tasks concurrently. Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) involves multiple processors of different types or capabilities each dedicated to specific tasks or processes.
Thrashing occurs when the system spends a significant amount of time swapping pages between physical memory and secondary storage due to excessive paging activity resulting in a decrease in overall system performance. It can be avoided by optimizing memory usage adjusting paging parameters or adding more physical memory.
The interrupt mechanism in an operating system allows hardware devices or external events to signal the CPU to suspend its current execution and handle the interrupt by invoking an interrupt service routine (ISR) to respond to the event or service the device ensuring timely and efficient handling of hardware events and interrupts.
The page table in virtual memory management is a data structure used by the operating system to map logical addresses generated by user-level processes to physical addresses in physical memory enabling memory isolation protection and efficient use of memory resources.
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands and executing programs. It interacts with the operating system by interpreting user commands invoking system calls and managing input/output operations.
First-come first-served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm assigns CPU time to processes in the order they arrive in the ready queue while shortest job next (SJN) scheduling algorithm prioritizes processes based on their execution time giving preference to shorter jobs to minimize waiting time and improve system throughput.
The job queue in a batch processing system is a queue that holds jobs submitted by users or processes waiting to be processed by the operating system. It ensures that jobs are executed in the order they were received and provides a mechanism for managing and prioritizing job execution.
A zombie process is a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table as its parent process has not yet collected its exit status. It occurs when a parent process fails to call the wait() system call to retrieve the exit status of its child process leading to resource leakage and potential system instability.
Preemptive multitasking allows the operating system to interrupt the execution of a process to allocate CPU time to another process ensuring fair CPU time allocation and responsiveness while non-preemptive multitasking relies on processes voluntarily yielding CPU control which can lead to poor system responsiveness and potential process starvation.
The swapping mechanism in virtual memory allows the operating system to move pages of memory between physical memory and secondary storage such as a hard drive to free up space in physical memory for other processes enabling efficient use of memory resources and facilitating multitasking and virtual memory management.
A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized threads that are created and managed by the operating system or a thread pool manager allowing efficient reuse of threads to execute tasks in parallel reducing thread creation overhead and improving system performance and responsiveness in multithreaded applications.
Process migration is the relocation of a process from one physical machine to another in a distributed computing environment to balance load improve resource utilization or enhance system availability and fault tolerance enabling dynamic resource management and workload distribution.
Static linking involves linking libraries and dependencies with the executable binary during the compilation process resulting in a single standalone executable file while dynamic linking links libraries and dependencies at runtime allowing shared libraries to be loaded into memory as needed reducing executable size and facilitating code updates and maintenance.
A critical section is a section of code or a segment of a program that accesses shared resources or variables and must be executed atomically to prevent race conditions data corruption or inconsistent behavior. It is protected using synchronization mechanisms such as locks semaphores or mutexes to ensure mutual exclusion and data integrity.
The superblock in a file system is a data structure that contains metadata about the file system such as the total number of blocks block size inode table location and free block bitmap providing essential information for file system operations management and recovery.
Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) refers to a multiprocessor system architecture in which two or more identical processors are connected to a single shared main memory and are capable of executing the same tasks concurrently. Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) involves multiple processors of different types or capabilities each dedicated to specific tasks or processes.
A fork bomb is a denial-of-service attack that involves recursively spawning new processes until system resources are exhausted causing the system to become unresponsive or crash due to excessive CPU or memory usage disrupting normal system operation and potentially causing data loss or system damage.
Mutual exclusion is a synchronization technique that ensures that only one process or thread can access a shared resource at a time preventing conflicts and data corruption. For example in a multi-threaded program mutual exclusion can be achieved using locks semaphores or other synchronization primitives to protect critical sections of code from concurrent access.
The page replacement algorithm is a mechanism used by the operating system to select which page to evict from physical memory when a page fault occurs and there is no free space available. It aims to minimize the number of page faults and optimize system performance by selecting pages based on various criteria such as least recently used (LRU) FIFO or optimal page replacement.
Preemptive scheduling allows the operating system to interrupt the execution of a process to allocate CPU time to another process ensuring fair CPU time allocation and responsiveness while non-preemptive scheduling relies on processes voluntarily yielding CPU control which can lead to poor system responsiveness and potential process starvation.
The file allocation table (FAT) in a file system is a data structure that stores information about the location and status of files and directories on a storage device such as a hard drive or flash drive. It provides a mapping between file names and their corresponding data blocks facilitating file access management and storage allocation in the file system.
