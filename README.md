# SAGA AI Interview System

## Overview
The *SAGA AI Interview System* is an advanced recruitment platform integrating *audio-video proctoring* and *comprehensive evaluation* through AI technologies. It aims to provide unbiased, secure, and efficient candidate assessments using *natural language processing (NLP)* and *computer vision*.

## Features
- *Automated Audio & Video Proctoring*: Ensures secure, fair interviews by monitoring verbal and non-verbal cues.
- *Speech & Sentiment Analysis: Uses *NLP and AI-driven techniques* to evaluate candidates' verbal responses.
- *Facial Recognition & Emotion Detection*: Analyzes expressions, attention, and stress levels.
- *Environmental Monitoring*: Detects external assistance and anomalies to maintain interview integrity.
- *Real-time Evaluation & Alerts*: Flags suspicious activities and provides instant feedback.
- *Scalable & Efficient*: Supports multiple simultaneous interviews.

## System Architecture
The system consists of two core modules:
1. *Audio Processing Module*:
   - Speech-to-text conversion using *Google Speech Recognition API*.
   - Sentiment analysis and syntactic parsing using *NLTK*.
2. *Video Proctoring Module*:
   - *OpenCV-based* facial recognition for identity verification.
   - Emotion detection and body language assessment.
   - Environmental analysis for unauthorized assistance detection.

## Evaluation Metrics
The system scores candidates on a *scale of 0 to 1* across three primary areas:
1. *AI Knowledge*
2. *Generative AI Expertise*
3. *Manual Testing Skills*

### Example Candidate Scores:
| Candidate | AI Knowledge | Gen AI Expertise | Manual Testing Skills |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Test1     | 0.87        | 0.85           | 0.39              |
| Test2     | 0.90        | 0.89           | 0.65              |
| Test3     | 0.93        | 0.92           | 0.80              |

## Security & Privacy Measures
- *End-to-end encryption* for data protection.
- *Access control mechanisms* to restrict unauthorized access.
- *Compliance with GDPR & CCPA* for candidate data privacy.

## Future Scope
- *Industry-Specific Adaptations*: Tailor NLP models for various job roles.
- *Multilingual Capabilities*: Expand language processing for global recruitment.
- *AI-Driven Role-Playing Scenarios*: Interactive and situational assessments.
- *Enhanced Computer Vision Algorithms*: Improved emotion detection and body language analysis.
- *Sophisticated Feedback Tools*: Detailed insights for recruiters and candidates.

## Conclusion
The *SAGA AI Interview System* represents a *cutting-edge* solution in AI-driven recruitment, *enhancing fairness, efficiency, and security. With its *scalable architecture, **real-time monitoring, and *bias-free evaluation, it is poised to *revolutionize* modern hiring practices.
